# Quantified Self

Quantified Self is a calorie tracker app written in Javascript! It allows you to enter foods and calorie counts, as well as exercises and calorie counts. It makes it easy to track consumption and expenditure of calories in a daily diary format. 

You can visit a demo version of the app [here](https://cdunagan05.github.io/quantified-self/). 

## Initial Setup

  git clone https://github.com/Cdunagan05/quantified-self
  ```

2. Change into the directory: 

	```
	cd quantified-self
	```

3. Install the app's dependencies:

4. Build the app with:

	```

	```

5. ...and launch it with:

	```
	npm start
	```
	
6. Access it in your browser by going to

	```

	```

## Run Tests in the Terminal

To run the application's tests:

	npm test
	
Note: You will need Selenium + A Driver + Firefox (or other browser with appropriate driver) installed to run these tests. A fully fledged guide to doing this is a bit beyond the scope of this readme, but you can go to the [Selenium Docs](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/) for basic instructions. For a driver, you can for example use the [npm package for geckodriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geckodriver).
